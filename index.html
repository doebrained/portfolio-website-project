        <p id="intro">Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Juniper Ferlan. I am currently an undergraduate student at University of Pittsburgh pursuing a BS in Computer Science. This website is the final project for "CMP 0610 - Composing Digital Media" taught by Professor Eldin. Linked below are the other projects made for this course.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="audio-narrative.html">Audio Narrative</a></li>
            <li><a href="video-essay.html">Video Essay</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Project Details:</h3>
        <p>&emsp;Following the creation of the audio narrative and video essay projects, work on this website was done in two phases: content and styling. Once a file structure was established, content was added using the HTML markup language, beginning with the index page (this one) and then adding individual pages for each project. Besides the projects themselves, the content for those pages came largely from the README files for those projects.</p>
        <br><p>&emsp;The CSS stylesheets were composed with the goal of keeping the website simple and clean while enhancing readability. To achieve this I elected to use a mostly monochromatic style with rounded fieldsets and a darker background color to soften the appearance of the pages even with substantial amounts of text.</p>
        <br><p>&emsp; With the completion of this project, my work for the Composing Digital Media course comes to a close. Across all three of the projects I established skills not only in audio/video scripting and editing as well as basic webpage creation, but also refined my transferable project planning and execution abilities. I anticipate that this coursework will prove to be a firm foundation for any multimedia projects I create in the future.</p>
